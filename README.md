# X-chain-Factorization
We provide a Mathematica package for finding the X-chains of graph states, representing graph states and their Schmidt decomposition in X-basis and calculating the overlap of two graph states.
All the functions are derived according to the Paper [reference to be given].

# -------------------------------------------------
Put the package "XchainFactorization.m" in the root directory of your Mathematica.
The file "XchainFactoriztion_usage_guide.nb" contains examples of the usage of this package, which demonstrate the result in the Paper [reference to be given].
